- [ ] There should be many worlds to land on
  - Earth
  - Moon
- [ ] There should be multiple difficulty levels
  - Easy mode starts with just a vertical thrust, landing on flat ground
  - Medium mode starts with vertical and horizontal thrust, but mostly flat ground
  - Difficult starts at a faster vertical and horizontal thrust, and flat land is hard to come by
  - Master? Same as difficult but with objects that can get in our way
    - Planes on Earth, the Lunar spacecraft on the Moon, spaceships on Mars, storms on Jupiter, diamonds on saturn, etc.
- [ ] User should be able to control the space craft
  - Thrusting happens with the push of a button
    - Spacebar to thrust
  - User should be able to change the angle of the thrusters
    - Mouse movement controls the butt of the rocket
- [ ] Thrusting should range from `0 m/s` up to some `MAX m/s`
- [ ] More thrust burns more fuel and vise-versa
- [ ] There should be some sort of scoring system
  - User gets a score based on how well the ship was landing by considering many factors:
    - The speed at which it was landed
      - Max points for some **range** `m/s`
      - Points increasingly deducted if outside this range
    - Damage the ship has received
      - Infinite "health bar" for `Easy` mode
      - Less of a health bar for the rest
    - Amount of fuel remaining
      - Max points for some **range** of fuel left
      - Points increasingly deducted if less than this amount
